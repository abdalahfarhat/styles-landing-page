A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/luispompa/pen/PPGLBd.

 
Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that successfully reverse-engineers this: http://codepen.io/ThiagoFerreir4/full/eNMxEp.

Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code on CodePen. Figure it out for yourself.

Rule #2: You may use whichever libraries or APIs you need.

Rule #3: Reverse engineer the example project's functionality, and also feel free to personalize it.

Hint: If you don't want to start from scratch, you can fork this simple Bootstrap portfolio template on CodePen: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/pen/mJNqQj.

Here are the user stories you must enable, and optional bonus user stories:

User Story: As a user, I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.

User Story: As a user, I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.

User Story: As a user, I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)

Bonus User Story: As a user, I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

Don't worry if you don't have anything to showcase on your portfolio yet - you will build several several apps on the next few CodePen challenges, and can come back and update your portfolio later.

There are many great portfolio templates out there, but for this challenge, you'll need to build a portfolio page yourself. Using Bootstrap will make this much easier for you.

Note that CodePen.io overrides the Window.open() function, so if you want to open windows using jquery, you will need to target invisible anchor elements like this one: <a target='_blank'>.
