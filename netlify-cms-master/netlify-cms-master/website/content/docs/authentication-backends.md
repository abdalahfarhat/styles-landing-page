Netlify CMS stores content in your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository. In order for this to work, authenticate with your Git host. In most cases that requires a server. We have a few options for handling this.

**Note:** Some static site generators have plugins for optimized integration with Netlify CMS, and starter templates may utilize these plugins. If you're using a starter template, read the template documentation before proceeding, as their instructions may differ.

## Git Gateway with Netlify Identity

[Git Gateway](https://github.com/netlify/git-gateway) is a Netlify open source project that allows you to add editors to your site CMS without giving them direct write access to your GitHub or GitLab repository. (For Bitbucket repositories, use the [Bitbucket backend](#bitbucket-backend) instead.) [Netlify Identity](https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity/) service can handle the authentication and provides a simple interface for user management. The Netlify CMS [featured templates](../start-with-a-template) are working examples of this backend.

To use it in your own project stored on GitHub or GitLab, follow these steps:

1. Head over to the [Netlify Identity docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity) and follow the steps to get started.
2. Add the following lines to your Netlify CMS `config.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    backend:
      name: git-gateway
      accept_roles: #optional - accepts all users if left out
        - admin
        - editor
    ```

3. Optionally, you can assign roles to users in your Netlify dashboard, and then limit which roles can access the CMS by defining the `accept_roles` field as shown in the example above. Otherwise `accept_roles` can be left out, and all Netlify Identity users on your site have access.

### Reconnect after Changing Repository Permissions

If you change ownership on your repository, or convert a repository from public to private, you may need to reconnect Git Gateway with proper permissions. Find further instructions in the [Netlify Git Gateway docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs/git-gateway/#reconnect-after-changing-repository-permissions).

## Git Gateway without Netlify

You can use [Git Gateway](https://github.com/netlify/git-gateway) without Netlify by setting up your own Git Gateway server and connecting it with your own instance of [GoTrue](https://www.gotrueapi.org) (the open source microservice that powers Netlify Identity), or with any other identity service that can issue JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

To configure in Netlify CMS, use the same `backend` settings in your Netlify CMS `config.yml` file as described in Step 2 of the [Git Gateway with Netlify Identity](#git-gateway-with-netlify-identity) instructions above.

## GitHub Backend

For repositories stored on GitHub, the `github` backend allows CMS users to log in directly with their GitHub account. Note that all users must have push access to your content repository for this to work.

Because Github [requires a server](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/663#issuecomment-335023723) for authentication, Netlify facilitates basic GitHub authentication.

To enable basic GitHub authentication:

1. Follow the authentication provider setup steps in the [Netlify docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs/authentication-providers/#using-an-authentication-provider).
2. Add the following lines to your Netlify CMS `config.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    backend:
      name: github
      repo: owner-name/repo-name # Path to your GitHub repository
    ```

If you prefer to run your own authentication server, check out the section on [external OAuth clients](#external-oauth-clients).

## GitLab Backend

For repositories stored on GitLab, the `gitlab` backend allows CMS users to log in directly with their GitLab account. Note that all users must have push access to your content repository for this to work.

The GitLab API allows for two types of OAuth2 flows:

* [Web Application Flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/api/oauth2.html#web-application-flow), which works much like the GitHub OAuth flow described above.
* [Implicit Grant](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/api/oauth2.html#implicit-grant), which operates _without_ the need for an authentication server.

### Web Application Flow with Netlify

When using GitLab's Web Application Flow for authentication, you can use Netlify to handle the server-side authentication requests.

To enable it:

1. Follow the [GitLab docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html#adding-an-application-through-the-profile) to add your Netlify CMS instance as an OAuth application. For the **Redirect URI**, enter `https://api.netlify.com/auth/done`, and check the box for `api` scope.
2. Follow the [Netlify docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs/authentication-providers/#using-an-authentication-provider) to add your new GitLab Application ID and Secret to your Netlify site dashboard.
3. In your repository, add the following lines to your Netlify CMS `config.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    backend:
      name: gitlab
      repo: owner-name/repo-name # Path to your GitLab repository
    ```

### Client-Side Implicit Grant

With GitLab's Implicit Grant, users can authenticate with GitLab directly from the client. To do this:

1. Follow the [GitLab docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html#adding-an-application-through-the-profile) to add your Netlify CMS instance as an OAuth application. For the **Redirect URI**, enter the address where you access Netlify CMS, for example, `https://www.mysite.com/admin/`. For scope, select `api`.
2. GitLab gives you an **Application ID**. Copy this ID and enter it in your Netlify CMS `config.yml` file, along with the following settings:

    ```yaml
    backend:
      name: gitlab
      repo: owner-name/repo-name # Path to your GitLab repository
      auth_type: implicit # Required for implicit grant
      app_id: your-app-id # Application ID from your GitLab settings
    ```

    You can also use Implicit Grant with a self-hosted GitLab instance. This requires adding `api_root`, `base_url`, and `auth_endpoint` fields:

    ```yaml
    backend:
      name: gitlab
      repo: owner-name/repo-name # Path to your GitLab repository
      auth_type: implicit # Required for implicit grant
      app_id: your-app-id # Application ID from your GitLab settings
      api_root: https://my-hosted-gitlab-instance.com/api/v4
      base_url: https://my-hosted-gitlab-instance.com
      auth_endpoint: oauth/authorize
    ```

**Note:** In both cases, GitLab also provides you with a client secret. You should _never_ store this in your repo or reveal it in the client.

## Bitbucket Backend

For repositories stored on Bitbucket, the `bitbucket` backend allows CMS users to log in directly with their Bitbucket account. Note that all users must have write access to your content repository for this to work.

To enable it:

1. Follow the authentication provider setup steps in the [Netlify docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs/authentication-providers/#using-an-authentication-provider).
2. Add the following lines to your Netlify CMS `config.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    backend:
      name: bitbucket
      repo: owner-name/repo-name # Path to your Bitbucket repository
    ```

## Test Repo Backend
You can use the `test-repo` backend to try out Netlify CMS without connecting to a Git repo. With this backend, you can write and publish content normally, but any changes will disapear when you reload the page. This backend powers the Netlify CMS [demo site](https://cms-demo.netlify.com/).

To enable this backend, add the following lines to your Netlify CMS `config.yml` file:

```
backend:
  name: test-repo
```

## External OAuth Clients

If you would like to facilitate your own OAuth authentication rather than use Netlify's service or implicit grant, you can use one of the community-maintained projects below.

## Options

Netlify CMS backends allow some additional fields for certain use cases. A full reference is below. Note that these are properties of the `backend` field, and should be nested under that field.

| Field           | Default                                                        | Description                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `repo`          | none                                                           | **Required** for `github`, `gitlab`, and `bitbucket` backends; ignored by `git-gateway`. Follows the pattern `[org-or-username]/[repo-name]`.                                    |
| `accept_roles`  | none                                                           | `git-gateway` only. Limits CMS access to your defined array of user roles. Omitting this field gives access to all registered users.                 |
| `branch`        | `master`                                                       | The branch where published content is stored. All CMS commits and PRs are made to this branch.                                                       |
| `api_root`      | `https://api.github.com` (GitHub), `https://gitlab.com/api/v4` (GitLab), or `https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0` (Bitbucket)  | The API endpoint. Only necessary in certain cases, like with GitHub Enterprise or self-hosted GitLab.                                                                      |
| `site_domain`   | `location.hostname` (or `cms.netlify.com` when on `localhost`) | Sets the `site_id` query param sent to the API endpoint. Non-Netlify auth setups will often need to set this for local development to work properly. |
| `base_url`      | `https://api.netlify.com` (GitHub, Bitbucket) or `https://gitlab.com` (GitLab)                                     | OAuth client URL. **Required** when using an external OAuth server or self-hosted GitLab.                               |
| `auth_endpoint` | `auth` (GitHub, Bitbucket) or `oauth/authorize` (GitLab)                  | Path to append to `base_url` for authentication requests. Optional.                                                                                  |
