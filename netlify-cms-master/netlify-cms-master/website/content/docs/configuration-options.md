All configuration options for Netlify CMS are specified in a `config.yml` file, in the folder where you access the editor UI (usually in the `/admin` folder).

Alternatively, you can specify a custom config file using a link tag:

```html
<!-- Note the "type" and "rel" attribute values, which are required. -->

<link href="path/to/config.yml" type="text/yaml" rel="cms-config-url">
```

To see working configuration examples, you can [start from a template](../start-with-a-template) or check out the [CMS demo site](https://cms-demo.netlify.com). (No login required: click the login button and the CMS will open.) You can refer to the demo [configuration code](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/blob/master/dev-test/config.yml) to see how each option was configured.

You can find details about all configuration options below. Note that [YAML syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#Basic_components) allows lists and objects to be written in block or inline style, and the code samples below include a mix of both.


## Backend

*This setting is required.*

The `backend` option specifies how to access the content for your site, including authentication. Full details and code samples can be found in [Authentication & Backends](../authentication-backends).

**Note**: no matter where you access Netlify CMS — whether running locally, in a staging environment, or in your published site — it will always fetch and commit files in your hosted repository (for example, on GitHub), on the branch you configured in your Netlify CMS config.yml file. This means that content fetched in the admin UI will match the content in the repository, which may be different from your locally running site. It also means that content saved using the admin UI will save directly to the hosted repository, even if you're running the UI locally or in staging.

## Publish Mode

By default, all entries created or edited in the Netlify CMS are committed directly into the main repository branch.

The `publish_mode` option allows you to enable "Editorial Workflow" mode for more control over the content publishing phases. All unpublished entries will be arranged in a board according to their status, and they can be further reviewed and edited before going live.

**Note:** Editorial workflow works with GitHub repositories only. Support for other Git hosts is [coming soon](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/568).

You can enable the Editorial Workflow with the following line in your Netlify CMS `config.yml` file:

```yaml
publish_mode: editorial_workflow
```

From a technical perspective, the workflow translates editor UI actions into common Git commands:

Actions in Netlify UI ...	| Perform these Git actions
--- | ---
Save draft | Commits to a new branch (named according to the pattern `cms/collectionName-entrySlug`), and opens a pull request
Edit draft | Pushes another commit to the draft branch/pull request
Approve and publish draft | Merges pull request and deletes branch


## Media and Public Folders

*This setting is required.*

Netlify CMS users can upload files to your repository using the Media Gallery. The following settings specify where these files are saved, and where they can be accessed on your built site.

**Options**

- `media_folder` (required): Folder path where uploaded files should be saved, relative to the base of the repo.
- `public_folder` (optional): Folder path where uploaded files will be accessed, relative to the base of the built site. For fields controlled by [file] or [image] widgets, the value of the field is generated by prepending this path to the filename of the selected file. Defaults to the value of `media_folder`, with an opening `/` if one is not already included.

**Example**

``` yaml
media_folder: "static/images/uploads"
public_folder: "/images/uploads"
```

Based on the settings above, if a user used an image widget field called `avatar` to upload and select an image called `philosoraptor.png`, the image would be saved to the repository at `/static/images/uploads/philosoraptor.png`, and the `avatar` field for the file would be set to `/images/uploads/philosoraptor.png`.

## Media Library

Media library integrations are configured via the `media_library` property, and its value should be
an object with at least a `name` property. A `config` property can also be used for options that
should be passed to the library in use.

**Example**

```yaml
media_library:
  name: uploadcare
  config:
    publicKey: demopublickey
```

## Display URL

When the `display_url` setting is specified, the CMS UI will include a link in the fixed area at the top of the page, allowing content authors to easily return to your main site. The text of the link consists of the URL less the protocol portion (e.g., `your-site.com`).

**Example:**

```yaml
display_url: https://your-site.com
```

## Custom Logo

When the `logo_url` setting is specified, the CMS UI will change the logo displayed at the top of the login page, allowing you to brand the CMS with your own logo. `logo_url` is assumed to be a URL to an image file.

**Example:**

```yaml
logo_url: https://your-site.com/images/logo.svg
```

## Slug Type

The `slug` option allows you to change how filenames for entries are created and sanitized. For modifying the actual data in a slug, see the per-collection option below.

`slug` accepts multiple options:

- `encoding`
  - `unicode` (default): Sanitize filenames (slugs) according to [RFC3987](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987) and the [WHATWG URL spec](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/). This spec allows non-ASCII (or non-Latin) characters to exist in URLs.
  - `ascii`: Sanitize filenames (slugs) according to [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986). The only allowed characters are (0-9, a-z, A-Z, `_`, `-`, `~`).
- `clean_accents`: Set to `true` to remove diacritics from slug characters before sanitizing. This is often helpful when using `ascii` encoding.
- `sanitize_replacement`: The replacement string used to substitute unsafe characters, defaults to  `-`.

**Example**

``` yaml
slug:
  encoding: "ascii"
  clean_accents: true
  sanitize_replacement: "_"
```

## Collections

*This setting is required.*

The `collections` setting is the heart of your Netlify CMS configuration, as it determines how content types and editor fields in the UI generate files and content in your repository. Each collection you configure displays in the left sidebar of the Content page of the editor UI, in the order they are entered into your Netlify CMS `config.yml` file.

`collections` accepts a list of collection objects, each with the following options:

- `name` (required): unique identifier for the collection, used as the key when referenced in other contexts (like the [relation widget](../widgets/#relation))
- `label`: label for the collection in the editor UI; defaults to the value of `name`
- `label_singular`: singular label for certain elements in the editor; defaults to the value of `label`
- `description`: optional text, displayed below the label when viewing a collection
- `file` or `folder` (requires one of these): specifies the collection type and location; details in [Collection Types](../collection-types)
- `filter`: optional filter for `folder` collections; details in [Collection Types](../collection-types)
- `create`: for `folder` collections only; `true` allows users to create new items in the collection; defaults to `false`
- `delete`: `false` prevents users from deleting items in a collection; defaults to `true`
- `extension`: see detailed description below
- `format`: see detailed description below
- `frontmatter_delimiter`: see detailed description under `format`
- `slug`: see detailed description below
- `fields` (required): see detailed description below
- `editor`: see detailed description below

The last few options require more detailed information.

### `extension` and `format`

These settings determine how collection files are parsed and saved. Both are optional—Netlify CMS will attempt to infer your settings based on existing items in the collection. If your collection is empty, or you'd like more control, you can set these fields explicitly.

`extension` determines the file extension searched for when finding existing entries in a folder collection and it determines the file extension used to save new collection items. It accepts the following values: `yml`, `yaml`, `toml`, `json`, `md`, `markdown`, `html`.

You may also specify a custom `extension` not included in the list above, as long as the collection files can be parsed and saved in one of the supported formats below.

`format` determines how collection files are parsed and saved. It will be inferred if the `extension` field or existing collection file extensions match one of the supported extensions above. It accepts the following values:

- `yml` or `yaml`: parses and saves files as YAML-formatted data files; saves with `yml` extension by default
- `toml`: parses and saves files as TOML-formatted data files; saves with `toml` extension by default
- `json`: parses and saves files as JSON-formatted data files; saves with `json` extension by default
- `frontmatter`: parses files and saves files with data frontmatter followed by an unparsed body text (edited using a `body` field); saves with `md` extension by default; default for collections that can't be inferred. Collections with `frontmatter` format (either inferred or explicitly set) can parse files with frontmatter in YAML, TOML, or JSON format. However, they will be saved with YAML frontmatter.
- `yaml-frontmatter`: same as the `frontmatter` format above, except frontmatter will be both parsed and saved only as YAML, followed by unparsed body text. The default delimiter for this option is  `---`.
- `toml-frontmatter`: same as the `frontmatter` format above, except frontmatter will be both parsed and saved only as TOML, followed by unparsed body text. The default delimiter for this option is  `+++`.
- `json-frontmatter`: same as the `frontmatter` format above, except frontmatter will be both parsed and saved as JSON, followed by unparsed body text. The default delimiter for this option is  `{` `}`.

`frontmatter_delimiter`: if you have an explicit frontmatter format declared, this option allows you to specify a custom delimiter like `~~~`. If you need different beginning and ending delimiters, you can use an array like `["(", ")"]`.


### `slug`

For folder collections where users can create new items, the `slug` option specifies a template for generating new filenames based on a file's creation date and `title` field. (This means that all collections with `create: true` must have a `title` field.)

**Available template tags:**

- `{{slug}}`: a url-safe version of the `title` field for the file
- `{{year}}`: 4-digit year of the file creation date
- `{{month}}`: 2-digit month of the file creation date
- `{{day}}`: 2-digit day of the month of the file creation date
- `{{hour}}`: 2-digit hour of the file creation date
- `{{minute}}`: 2-digit minute of the file creation date
- `{{second}}`: 2-digit second of the file creation date

**Example:**

```yaml
slug: "{{year}}-{{month}}-{{day}}_{{slug}}"
```

### `fields`

The `fields` option maps editor UI widgets to field-value pairs in the saved file. The order of the fields in your Netlify CMS `config.yml` file determines their order in the editor UI and in the saved file.

`fields` accepts a list of collection objects, each with the following options:

- `name` (required): unique identifier for the field, used as the key when referenced in other contexts (like the [relation widget](../widgets/#relation))
- `label`: label for the field in the editor UI; defaults to the value of `name`
- `widget`: defines editor UI and inputs and file field data types; details in [Widgets](../widgets)
- `default`: specify a default value for a field; available for most widget types (see [Widgets](../widgets) for details on each widget type). Please note that field default value only works for folder collection type.
- `required`: specify as `false` to make a field optional; defaults to `true`
- `pattern`: add field validation by specifying a list with a regex pattern and an error message; more extensive validation can be achieved with [custom widgets](../custom-widgets/#advanced-field-validation)

In files with frontmatter, one field should be named `body`. This special field represents the section of the document (usually markdown) that comes after the frontmatter.

**Example:**

```yaml
fields:
  - label: "Title"
    name: "title"
    widget: "string"
    pattern: ['.{20,}', "Must have at least 20 characters"]
  - {label: "Layout", name: "layout", widget: "hidden", default: "blog"}
  - {label: "Featured Image", name: "thumbnail", widget: "image", required: false}
  - {label: "Body", name: "body", widget: "markdown"}
```

### `editor`

This setting changes options for the editor view of the collection. It has one option so far:

- `preview`: set to `false` to disable the preview pane for this collection; defaults to `true`

**Example:**

```yaml
  editor:
     preview: false
```
