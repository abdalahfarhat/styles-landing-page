A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/brownerd/pen/BjEMyQ.

 Having fun with the second personal challenge of Free Code Camp. The challenge is to make a personal portfolio page. Since I'm required to use CodePen for this, I figured that I'd simply use my Pens for the portfolio content. As this course continues I will be making a bunch of other projects using CodePen. I'll eventually replace my old Pens listed here with the new project Pens from the FCC course.

Free Code Camp offers free self-guided coding tutorials. Each tut is broken down in to a mini lesson that teaches you how to build a larger project. I'd happily recommend Free Code Camp to anyone that is looking to learn how to get started writing code.
