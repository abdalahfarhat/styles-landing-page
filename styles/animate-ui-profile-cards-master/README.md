On the web presenting large chunks of information remains a challenge. If there is a structure / architecture to be found in that information, we can organize and present the information one chunk at the time.

### The HTML
The HTML is heavily commented to make identifying the elements easy and to understand their function.

### The CSS
The CSS is heavily commented to explain the individual rules.
