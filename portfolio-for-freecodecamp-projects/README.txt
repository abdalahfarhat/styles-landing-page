A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/denmch/pen/KpjYVM.

 So this is my entry for the Free Code Camp portfolio Zipline.

The parallax effect is borrowed from Keith Clark's pure CSS parallax scrolling technique (see http://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/), which I learned about in a slide deck by Paul Irish on parallax performance.

The image in slide 1 is from my once (and future?) web comic, the CSS background patterns in slide 2 and 3 are taken from Lea Verou's awesome collection (http://lea.verou.me/css3patterns/), and while the photo in slide 4 looks like a cleaner version of my desk, it comes from the terrific free stock photo collection at Unsplash (https://unsplash.com).
